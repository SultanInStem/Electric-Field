# Electric Field Simulation

## Overview
This project is a Python-based simulation of electric fields, developed using **Pygame**. It provides a visual representation of how electric field vectors behave in the presence of point charges. The simulation is built with an object-oriented design, making it modular and easy to extend.

## Features
- Visualization of electric field vectors.
- Dynamic interaction between charges.
- Ability to add, move, and remove charges.
- Adjustable charge magnitudes and positions.
- Object-oriented architecture with classes for `Charge`, `Vector`, and `Canvas`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or later
- Pygame 2.0 or later


## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/electric-field-simulation.git
   cd electric-field-simulation
   ```
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   python3 main.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Adding Charges**: Use space to add a sensor charge.
- **Moving Charges**: Drag charges with the mouse to see real-time updates to the field.
- **Customizing Charges**: Modify the charge magnitude and position in `canvas.py`.
